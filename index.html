        <p class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-about"><strong>Determined and Hardworking Game Developer</strong></p>
        <div class="about-me-body">
            <p>Iâ€™m a Computer Science major with a Master's Degree in Computer Science and I attended New York Institute of Technology. I have had a passion for video games ever since I was a small kid, playing all sorts of games like Pokemon and Destiny throughout my life. After developing a passion for Computer Science, I thought that this could be a way in which I can get involved working in the gaming Industry.</p>
            <p>As a Computer Science student, I was taught multiple languages and programs, such as Java and database management through MySQL, which enhanced my knowledge of different technologies. I self-taught myself C# and Unity in order to understand the fundamentals of game design and further develop my skills.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, you would find me messing around with creating new game mechanics and enhancing my knowledge of game design, or grinding away on a video game.</p>
            <p>Through playing countless games and being inspired by the different mechanics and thoughts put into them, my passion truly lies in game development, and I hope to work with other like-minded people in the future.</p>
