            <h2 class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-portfolio"><strong>Moving Obstacles</strong></h2>
            <p>In order to distinguish each new area, a new mechanic is introduced to the player to add new elements to the gameplay. Initially the player is introduced to moving obstacles, making it so obstacles are not statically stuck in place.</p>

            <h2 class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-portfolio"><strong>Moving Platforms</strong></h2>
            <p>After the player is introduced to the concept that obstacles can move, why not the platforms? The landing platform is capable of moving making it so the timing in which the player can actually land on the platform has to be more strategic.</p>

            <h2 class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-portfolio"><strong>Dynamic Lighting</strong></h2>
            <p>With the rocket having a light source attached to the front of it, this allows us to change up the lighting of the map and make the player respond to not being able to see everything permanently. Lights around the map can turn on and off based on a predetermined flicker speed that allows the map to be shadowed in darkness as the player has to use the rocket light source to show where they are and the obstacles surrounding them.</p>

            <h2 class="section-subtitle section-subtitle-portfolio"><strong>Disappearing Obstacles</strong></h2>
            <p>In order to really test the player, their memorization skills are called into action. Obstacles and platforms can disappear and it is up to the player to remember where they are located. Similar to the dynamic lighting feature, a predetermined flicker speed is applied to these objects to make them disappear and appear.</p>
